# Walmart - Confidence Interval and CLT

**About Walmart**

Walmart is a retail giant, renowned for its vast array of products, competitive prices, and widespread accessibility. With its roots in the United States, Walmart has expanded its operations to numerous countries, making it a global force in the retail industry.

**Objective of the Case Study**

Comprehensive data analysis was performed on this Walmart dataset, focusing on its structure, handling null values, and identifying outliers. Spending patterns of male and female customers were analyzed to derive confidence intervals and actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

This dataset contains transactional data from customers who made purchases at Walmart stores during Black Friday. It contains approximately 0.5 million transactions collected over various years.  

| **Feature**                | **Description**                                                |  
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **User_ID**                | Unique ID assigned to each customer                           |  
| **Product_ID**             | ID of the purchased product                                   |  
| **Gender**                 | Customer's gender (Male/Female)                               |  
| **Age**                    | Age of the customer (categorized into bins)                  |  
| **Occupation**             | Customer's occupation (anonymized)                           |  
| **City_Category**          | City classification (A, B, or C)                             |  
| **StayInCurrentCityYears** | Number of years the customer has lived in their current city |  
| **Marital_Status**         | Marital status (0 = Unmarried, 1 = Married)                  |  
| **ProductCategory**        | Category of the product (anonymized)                         |  
| **Purchase**               | Purchase amount                                              |    

### **Key Objectives:**  
1. Imported and examined the dataset's structure.  
2. Addressed missing values and identified outliers using boxplots and statistical summaries.  
3. Analyzed spending per transaction for male and female customers, comparing average expenditures.  
4. Used sample averages to estimate population spending, applied the Central Limit Theorem to calculate confidence intervals, and assessed mean distributions with varying sample sizes.  
5. Compared confidence intervals (95%) and evaluated results based on overlapping or distinct intervals.  
6. Provided strategic recommendations based on findings, particularly the implications of overlapping confidence intervals.  
7. Extended the analysis to explore spending differences between married and unmarried customers.  
8. Categorized age into bins to study spending patterns across life stages.  

This analysis offers Walmart data-driven insights into customer spending behavior, aiding in improved decision-making and tailored marketing strategies.
